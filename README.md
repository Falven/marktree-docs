# MarkTree

MarkTree is a dev power tool for effortlessly copying any aspect of source control: directory structures, file contents, tabs, and even Git diffs, into Markdown. Take advantage of the latest LLMs or Agentic systems like V0, Gemini, GPT 4.1 or new Claude releases without waiting for GitHub Copilot or Cursor support. Provide advanced context beyond what these IDEs support.

### Copying Open Tabs as Markdown

If you frequently work with multiple files at once, MarkTree lets you copy the contents of all currently open file-based tabs as Markdown. You can also limit copying to tabs on the right or left of the active one. This makes it easy to share precisely the subset you need.

- **Copy All Tabs**: Copies all open file-based tabs.
- **Copy Tabs to the Right**: Copy a selection of files opened to the right of the current focus.
- **Copy Tabs to the Left**: Quickly capture the files opened to the left side.

### Copying Problems from the Active File

MarkTree can collect and copy all **diagnostics** (errors, warnings, etc.) for your currently active fileâ€”complete with **line numbers**, **messages**, and **code snippet** context.

When you run **Copy Problems from Active File**, youâ€™ll get a Markdown snippet like:

#### Problems for /path/to/file.ts

##### Issue 1 of 2

- **Severity**: Error
- **Line**: 12, **Column**: 5
- **Source**: eslint
- **Message**: Unexpected token

11    bar: 42
